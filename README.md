# 🩺 Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy  
### AI-Based Smart Bridge Healthcare Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can lead to permanent vision loss if not detected early.

This project uses **Deep Learning and Computer Vision** to automatically detect Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal (fundus) images.

The system classifies images into:
- ✅ Normal
- ⚠️ Diabetic Retinopathy Detected

The goal is to assist healthcare professionals with faster and more reliable early diagnosis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Develop a CNN-based Deep Learning model for DR detection
- Provide early-stage screening support
- Build a user-friendly web interface
- Promote AI-driven healthcare solutions
